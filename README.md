My first repository
Hi I've never done this before hopefully it will work out. My goal is to learn the coding languages html(check), css(check), javascript(check), and Java(check). We'll see how it goes.


UPDATE 1/28/2015

Spent a lot of time learning Java and developed my first business project. It's a piece of software the aides users in getting data off of bar graphs found on electric bills. It's being used by my company! great sucess!
